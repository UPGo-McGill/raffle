#' Raffle to assign STR listings to administrative units for spatial analysis
#' 
#' A function for probablistically assigning STR listings to administrative
#' geographies (e.g. census tracts) based on reported latitude/longitude.
#' The function works by combining a known probability density function (e.g.
#' Airbnb's spatial obfuscation of listing locations) with an additional source
#' of information about possible listing locations--either population or housing
#' densities.
